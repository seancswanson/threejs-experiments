## Experiments in Space & Time

### Welcome!

You've stumbled upon an archive of experiments wherein I explore the fantastic realm of three-dimensional programming.

In the name of science and art I've started on a journey to investigate how to programmatically create models and animation in 3D.

The ultimate aim of this investigation is to learn how to best wield 3D visualizations to create art, games, and to tell stories with beautiful data.

In these experiments I am practicing modern JavaScript and am using the Three.js library, a cross-browser JavaScript library and Application Programming Interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.

The next step after a lot of cardio with these technologies is to dive into the underlying mathematics to understand WebGL further.
